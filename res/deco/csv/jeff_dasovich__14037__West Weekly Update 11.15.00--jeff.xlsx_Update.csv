SDG&E has proposed to use the overcollection from ongoing CTCs, which are collected from all customers, to offset its undercollections of the electricity procurement rate cap that was passed by the legislature last September.  Such an allocation will negatively affect our retail deals who do not benefit from the rate cap.   "," On reasonableness, the coalition in which we participate, ARM, Alliance for Retail Markets, will be monitoring, as any disallowance will affect our retail deals in SDG&E's service territory.

SCE/PG&E Revenue Undercollections,,,"Both SCE and PG&E filed motions to revise Commission Decisions which prevent them from carrying costs incurred during the transition period into the post-transition era.  PG&E and SCE are concerned about their ability to recover an increasing undercollection resulting from the rate freeze.  TURN had filed a motion that would allow PG&E/SCE to fold the undercollection into their stranded costs and maintain the same recovery period through 2001.  The Commission has indicated that they are only interested in interim accounting measures to provide relief.  The TURN measure gives the utilities an opportunity of recovery, which they can present to Wall Street in order to continue to issue s-t debt.  It is not a long-term solution, however, such a solution will not be dealt with in this proceeding.  There is another docket that will be opened in December to deal more broadly with issues around the continuation of the rate freeze.  Also this is likely to be the basis of a settlement going into the next legislative session.",Generally supportive of TURN's comments,"Filed comments 11/9 and are in the process of filing reply comments, due 11/17.",,There was unanimous consumer protest against the utilities proposals to flow through the undercollections.,2000-11-13 00:00:00,Mona Petrochko,
