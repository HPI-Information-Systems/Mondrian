2000-11-27 00:00:00,101,POLR Historical Usage,Complete,3 - Important,C. Moseley,15.1.2.7,Phase 2,"System was designed to send historical usage to POLR when customer sent to POLR.  The change to be implemented is that ERCOT will act as the transaction point and will receive the historical data and then send it to POLR upon POLR request.
Language boxed regarding usage directly to POLR until system change is implemented"

2 - Improvement",C. Moseley,16.2.12 (New),Phase 1,"Larger implications when introducing the default QSE than we had currently considered.  Alternatives were presented to RUG.  No drafted process on backup process existed. The PIwG anticipates no effect on design and recommends that the attached language be included in the supplemental Protocols filing.  Should the vendor assessment return a system impact, the PIwG will re-evaluate. RUG modified the PIwG proposal and requested Board define details on QSE Selection criteria. 
In addition, Protocol Change Process should address:
Collection and Payment of Default QSE Fees will need to be addressed. (Settlement)
Concern regarding QSE’s ability to establish communications/telemetry with Resources, etc. in time.
Financial Security implications need to be addressed.
Needs to limit the liability of the Default QSE for scheduling activities"

6.9.4.1
6.1.8",Phase 2,Current system design uses a simple capacity multiplied by a fee to determine payment.  The protocol has a more complex formula which uses a rolling unit availability factor. No Change to Protocols.  System Workaround required and offered to be supported by ERCOT.

ERCOT will perform a manual workaround until the system functionality to aggregate sub-QSEs for financial liability and invoicing purposes is implemented. RUG reviewed and changed status from Vital to Important."

4.3.2(8)",Phase 2,"System does not support bid premiums for Resource-specific settlement charges as specified.  Package 1 algorithms utilize premium in solving Local Congestion, but this data would need to be passed from Package 1 to Package 2 and included in Resource specific charges. There is no mechanism in the current design for submitting unit specific premium bids. A corresponding formula and charge type will need to be created. Drafts of the formula are boxed, but concerns that wording and language is not desired approach for settlement of local congestion. Resource Plan will include premiums for local energy.

System design based on current 814-04.  Cutover and conversion asks for station name rather than bus id. Texas SET has initiated a change request for the required items. Once the transaction supports the data sets, the currently boxed language can be included in the protocols."

Previous versions of the Protocols stated the processing times would be posted on MIS. Multiple sections have the references to delivery times struck for this release of the protocols and boxed to be included once the system can honor those timing requirements.
2000-12-06 00:00:00,189,"Off-cycle meter read request dates, Rejection of switch request",Complete,RESOLVED,Registration,15.1.1.10,RESOLVED,"Current design is based on the TDSP sending the first available on-cycle switch date if the CR requests an off-cycle date before the first available switch date. The current system design will not reject an off-cycle switch date preceding a first available switch date. The system is designed so that the TDSP selects a date after the first available switch date which ERCOT provided (see 15.1.1.6) in the 814_03.  If the CR requests an off-cycle date before the first available switch date, the system expectation is that the TDSP will send the first available on-cycle date.
As requested by RUG, the vendor will modify the system to send the reject code by June 1, 2001.

ERCOT will wait until the end of the customer review period before applying concurrent processing rules.  Both transactions will run concurrently with additional date validation occurring at the end date of the evaluation period. Language has been boxed to determine if there is a switch date in both requests, and evaluate the Drop to POLR request date with the end date of the evaluation period(s) and switch date."
