NY,Level 3 (Opt-in with a Supplemental Agreement for pricing and specific UNEs),Expires 9-30-02 (Negotiated),"Received all pricing for loop and transport up to OC-12 capacity (including dark fiber loop and transport).  Revised cross-connect pricing is being filed by Verizon in all 7 states at this time in accordance with the new FCC Collo Order.  Still negotiating loop and transport provisioning intervals for quantities that Verizon lists as ""negotiated.""  Verizon rejected our performance incentive plan and refuses to negotiate collocation intervals.  Reviewed red-lined terms and conditions of Level 3 agreement with Verizon (9/21), then with in-house and again with Verizon (10/1).  Reviewed pricing and technical issues (e.g., multiplexing, cross-connects, and collo) with Verizon (9/24).  Reviewed supplemental agreement with Verizon (10/1).  New arbitration windows currently apply in every state, varying in expiration from 10/30 to 11/13 (depending on the specific state).","Final discussion regarding Level 3 terms and conditions with Verizon SMEs and Enron in-house (tax, credit, legal, accounting, and insurance) will be next week (10/10).  Per Verizon, anticipate receipt of final documents (e.g., Level 3 agreement and supplemental agreement) the week of 10/22; of course, Enron will need to review and sign-off on Verizon's proposed final documents.  Will discuss red-lined terms and conditions of Sprint-GTE agreement for California (10/5). Follow-up with in-house regarding California agreement thereafter.  NOTE:  The same supplemental agreement will apply to the CA agreement (except for applicable pricing).",Early November 2001,2002-02-01 00:00:00,Approximately 76 days,"Verizon treats signature date as effective date; if collo not ready, January 2002."

TX,Multi-State Agreement / Negotiated,1 year plus 90 days,"Call w/ SBC on Monday, 9/24.  We had previously received cross-connection pricing up through OC48 loop for IL; OC-12 loop for TX and CA.  On CA OC-12 loop pricing, which was double the pricing for any other state, we've asked them to review it.  They proposed a compromise of one-half the difference between IL and CA.  We told them we would consider.  They are still considering our provisioning proposal, although they initially indicated they would not.  They have provided a firm schedule for provisioning OC-n loop on a 35-day period, with 5 of those days for a facilities check.  We have a 30-day provisioning period for transport for TX and IL, however all transport intervals in CA are ICB.  We will discuss this on our next call.  They also indicated a willingness to accept a parent guarantee in lieu of deposit requirements.  They would not accept a change in the choice of law or forum.  Other issues, i.e. confidentiality, escrow, etc. asked us to provide language and they would consider it.  Multiplexing is an option for transport only-not loop.  We expect to have a red-line agreement available (PacBell and Multi-State) by 10/8.  Expect to conclude negotiations by 10/31.  Have received a 2-month extension of the arbitration window.",We have received feedback from internal groups.  We have discussed these issues conceptually w/ SBC.
