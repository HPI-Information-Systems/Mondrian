Standard & Poors,BBB-,A-3,CreditWatch Negative,"Downgrade prompted by the credit implications of Enron's restatement of financial statements going back to 1997.  Investment-grade rating is predicated on the prospect for improvement of credit quality with acquisition by Dynegy and near-term liquidity enhancement of $1.5B of equity capital.  Credit quality of the post-merger Dynegy can be maintained if the company accomplishes the sales of Enron's noncore assets. Credit quality while the merger is pending can be maintained only if liquidity and the value of the company's trading franchise is preserved.  Any decrease in liquidity or in the soundness of the marketing and trading operations, as measured by regular reports of trading activity, profitability, and cash positions would result in a rating downgrade."

Moody's,Baa3,Not Prime,Review for Further Downgrade,"Moody's actions reflect the company's reduced financial flexibility as a result of a substantial loss of investor confidence.  [Enron] faces significant debt maturities over the near term, as well as the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation.  In addition, uncertainty surrounding the firm's contingent obligations created increased risk for debtholders.  Moody's review will focus on Enron's ability to further improve its liquidity and capital positions.  The rating agency would view a substantial near term injection of equity capital as a stabilizing event."

Fitch IBCA,BBB-,F-3,Evolving Status,"The revision down to Evolving Status from Rating Watch is based on conditions of the Enron and Dynegy transaction which addresses several major concerns with the most time sensitive being liquidity.  The $1.5B equity infusion improves Enron's liquidity position and appears to be adequate to fund cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions.  However, Enron faces significant refinancing risk.  Fitch anticipates that the surviving company's rating would move to the mid- 'BBB' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to deleverage its capital structure and the completion of the merger.
