Power Trading Audit Observations             B,Legal does not maintain approved confirmation templates to ensure confirmations sent to counterparties by deal clearing personnel include all terms that accurately reflect the transaction that the parties agreed to.   ,"Legal should maintain copies of approved confirmation templates and periodically review confirmations  (i.e. semi-annually or annually) sent to counterparties to ensure that the confirmations are proper.  In addition, for confirmations that require changes or additional verbiage to be added, management should determine the necessary documentation to be maintained in order to verify that legal has reviewed and approved those applicable confirmations",2001-12-31 00:00:00,Kim Theriot  Elizabeth Sager,,
