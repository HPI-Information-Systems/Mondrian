Terminal,Facility Owner,Capacity,Expansion Plans,,Capacity Owners,,,Supply,Notes,
Lake Charles,CMS Energy,1000,,,BG controls all storage capacity beginning in 2001-CMS has the right to fill the capacity if BG can't.,,,"Supply-all spot cargo, so up in the air (approx 60/day is firm).",Closed in 1984 at a cap of 600/day,
Everett,Distrigas-Tractabel,450,to expand to 1Bcf by the end of the year,,Distrigas-Tractabel,,,Trinidad and Algeria firm contracts. Say they will have no problems. Expect to bring in 90 cargos in 2001 = 640/d,200/day of the expansion will go to fire the Sythe Power Plant that is being built on site,
Cove Point,Williams,750,Expecting final FERC approval in July or August service date should be April 1 or by July,,"El Paso 250, BP 250, Shell 250",,,"Not specified, but shold not be a big issue because of the strong supply positions of the capacity owners and the more lucrative basis incentive.","Minimum storage level of 1.5 Bcf must be maintain in order to satisfy peak demand(winter) of customers(153 for 10 days). TransCo pieline interconnect on Dec 1st. So, Dominion and Columbia Gas connections. Mothballed in 1980 at a cap of 1Bcf/day.",
Elba Island,El Paso,675,"Should be taking ships at the beginning of 2001, has to be operating by the middle of March. Recently claiming they will be running in Q4 of 2001.",,"Up in the air until 2002 when Enron has 160/d(for 17 years), and BG the rest. Enron is currently debating with El Paso about whether their capacity starts Oct 1st or Jan 1st 2002.",,,Spot until 2003 when they will get 300mmcf/d from Trinidad,Probably most they will ever sendout is 550 due to Pipeline constraints. The Cyprus pipeline in 2003(300mmcf/d) will allow them to operate at full capacity.  Mothballed in 1980 at a cap of 540mmcf/day.,
