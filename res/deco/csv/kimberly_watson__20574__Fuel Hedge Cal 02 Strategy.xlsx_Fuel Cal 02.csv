As we evaluate the signals of the market place through technical analysis, we are watching the NYMEX prompt continuation price so that if prompt price closes above $3.355, then we have a good chance to observe more bullish price scenarios.  If NYMEX prompt price closes below $2.6150, then we have a greater chance of pushing into more bearish prices.  Therefore, the prices in blue represent target bullish prices (EP Permian Basis Adjusted) in which we feel comfortable in triggering.  The prices in red represent target bearish prices (EP Permian Basis Adjusted) that we would want to lock-in to protect against a more powerful decline in prices.  Currently, the most bearish NYMEX Cal 02 price estimate is $2.476 which translates to a most bearish Permian Basis Adjusted price of $2.366.      "

These target prices will be identified in Nov/Dec 2001."
