" For the 16S-12S fragment, Fst of all pairwises varied from 0.592 to 0.889 between populations in the ML reaches and populations in the SW China region, showing a highly significant difference (P < 0.001), with the corresponding gene flows (Nm) being rather limited (< 0.400) in between. Among the 15 populations in the ML reaches, Fst varied from 0.010 to 0.762, with some of them having little genetic differentiation (P > 0.05); however, some Fst originated from HBhh, HBga, AHzy, JXxj and JSzj had significant difference with some populations also in the ML reaches (P < 0.05). Among the 3 populations in the SW China region, the Fst between SCxc and two Yunnan populations (YNey and YNhq) showed highly significant difference (P < 0.001), while the Fst between YNey and YNhq had no difference (P > 0.05).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
