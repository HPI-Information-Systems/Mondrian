Bourns    ,"On March 23, 2011, Bourns, Inc. (""Bourns"") provided its customers with an update regarding the impact on Bourns’ business resulting from the aftermath of the March 11, 2011 earthquake in Japan. In that update Bourns noted that slight delays might occur due to cargo screening for radiation. Bourns is aware of continued customer concerns regarding the threat of radiation contamination to Bourns® products and/or raw materials exported from or manufactured in Japan.

Vishay  *,"Vishay has noted some Mosfets were affected.  The March 11 2011 Earthquake and subsequent events in Japan have caused some materials shortages in the supply chain. In most cases this has been transparent with our policy of dual sourcing, however we have identified a shortage in a key Epoxy Material used in the assembly of a limited set of Vishay Mosfet products.
In order to keep continuity of supply Vishay plans to transfer production to an existing alternate set of materials on these specific part types until the supply of this key Epoxy can resume. The list of parts that is affected is attached along with the new part type for the alternate set of materials, in most cases both sets of materials have been previously approved and supplied to our customers. In order to keep receiving product the backlog needs to be transferred to the alternate part number.
We are expecting this action to potentially last for some time until normal production can resume, we are monitoring the supply and will provide updates as the situation improves.

Vishay is in contact with their supply chain and once they are informed, they will advise details.Vishay has not yet been informed of any impact to its suppliers’ factories. Vishay’s Purchasing department is compiling data on the status of all its suppliers in order to monitor and avert or minimize potential disruptions to logistics and other functions.
