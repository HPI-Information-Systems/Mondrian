The LAL is used as a quantitative test to detect gram-
negative endotoxin in aqueous solutions used in patient
management. The LAL assay is not recommended for serum or
plasma samples due to the presence of inhibitory factors. It
is essential to maintain specimen sterility and prevent
false positive results from exogenous gram negative
bacteria.
