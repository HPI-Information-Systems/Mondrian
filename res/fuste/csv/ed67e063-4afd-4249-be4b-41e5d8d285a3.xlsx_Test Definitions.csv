Collection Instructions:
1. Collect a random urine specimen.
2. No preservative.
Additional Information: A timed 24-hour urine collection is usually the preferred specimen for measuring and interpreting this urinary analyte. Random collections normalized to urinary creatinine may be of clinical use in the following 2 scenarios:
1. In patients who cannot collect a 24-hour specimen, typically small children, a uric acid creatinine ratio can be used to approximate 24-hour excretion.
2. When acute renal failure secondary to uric acid is suspected, a uric acid to creatinine ratio (mg/mg) >1.0 is consistent with acute uric acid nephropathy, whereas values <0.75 are consistent with other causes of acute renal failure. (Kelton, J, Kelley, WN, Holmes, EW: A rapid method for the detection of acute uric acid nephropathy. Arch Intern Med 1978; 138:612).",1 mL,"Hemolysis	NA
