"Note: All stations in EU Member States, with at least 75 % data coverage for at least 8 years were included in the analysis. Concentrations per station type (T= traffic, U=Urban/Suburban, R=Rural) are given in mg/m3. In the diagram a geographical bias exists towards central Europe where there is a higher density of stations.",,,,,,,,,,
